  "summary": "Moments is a mobile-first React + TypeScript single-page app for planning small real-world moments (via a weekly calendar strip and “Plan a Moment” bottom sheet) and capturing private photo memories (camera → save confirmation → feeling check). The app is primarily local-first (planned moments, photo moments, user profile, and notifications stored in browser storage) with reactive UI updates via storage listeners and custom DOM events. It integrates Dfinity Internet Identity for authentication and includes a Motoko backend canister with role-based access control (admin bootstrap via environment token) plus profile/settings and photo APIs with blob storage wiring.",

    "Frontend is a React + TypeScript SPA using TanStack Router for navigation and TanStack React Query for shared caching (notably backend actor caching keyed by principal).",
    "UI is mobile-first and consistently rendered inside a centered phone-sized viewport (max ~390×844) over a full-screen backdrop to preserve a mobile layout on desktop.",
    "Styling uses Tailwind utilities plus extensive custom CSS (OKLCH design tokens, custom animations for onboarding, bottom sheets, modals, and toasts).",
    "Local-first persistence: planned moments, photo moments, and profile are stored in localStorage; the capture flow uses sessionStorage for draft state between screens.",
    "Same-tab data reactivity is implemented via custom DOM events (e.g., plannedMomentsChanged, moments_photos_updated, profile_updated) in addition to the browser storage event for cross-tab updates.",
    "Authentication is provided via a custom Internet Identity context/provider built on AuthClient; actor creation is identity-aware and initialized with an admin secret read from the URL hash (scrubbed after extraction).",
    "Backend is a Motoko canister composed via mixins (authorization + blob-storage maintenance endpoints). RBAC is first-user-admin bootstrapped via env var CAFFEINE_ADMIN_TOKEN and a user-provided secret.",
    "Repository now includes a reusable build-template scaffold (React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + ICP canister YAMLs) with deploy/build scripts (Dockerfile, icp.yaml, deploy.sh) and asset maintenance utilities (resize/prune images).",
    "Notifications are local-first: notifications are persisted in browser storage with unread state and timestamps, surfaced via floating chat-bubble popups near the logo and a dedicated inbox page with unread badge; updates propagate via storage listeners and custom events.",
    "Back-navigation (history pop) transitions are handled via a dedicated hook (useBackSlideNavigation) to apply consistent slide animations on route back actions."

  "known_issues": [
    "Two global CSS entrypoints exist (frontend/index.css and frontend/src/index.css). The app imports frontend/src/index.css via src/main.tsx; the other file can drift and cause confusion.",
    "CameraScreen flash toggle is UI-only; the camera hook does not implement torch/flash control.",
    "Backend canister state (maps/counters/roles) is not stable; data will be lost on upgrade without stable variables and preupgrade/postupgrade handling.",
    "backend/blob-storage/Storage.mo references env var CAFFFEINE_STORAGE_CASHIER_PRINCIPAL (likely misspelled), increasing deployment misconfiguration risk.",
    "backend/blob-storage/Storage.mo refillCashier computes Nat.sub(currentBalance, reservedCycles); if currentBalance < reservedCycles this can trap due to Nat underflow.",
    "authorization/access-control.mo traps for unregistered users in getUserRole; callers must ensure initialization occurs for new principals before permission checks.",
    "Local storage can become full; current UX does not allow users to delete existing stored items to recover space.",
