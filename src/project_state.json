    "Backend blob-storage helper uses environment variables to locate a ‘cashier’ canister and to fetch authorized gateway principals; includes maintenance methods for dead-blob pruning and cycles refill.",
    "Introduced a frontend `StorageClient` utility to centralize localStorage access and standardize storage keys/serialization used across pages (e.g., camera capture, moments viewer, calendar).",
    "Build template updated to include shadcn/ui component implementations (e.g., button, dialog, sheet, etc.) and related tooling/config (eslint rules, utils, hooks), expanding the UI component infrastructure available to the app.",
    "Added planned-moments local persistence layer (plannedMomentsStorage + usePlannedMoments hook) and a dedicated PlannedMomentBottomSheet component to support calendar-based planned moment creation and retrieval by date.",
    "Calendar planned-moment creation bottom sheet should be half-height (reaches ~50% screen), with smooth slide-up on open and smooth slide-down on close; inputs (time/title/etc.) should use pill-style containers consistent with the search bar theme; action buttons should be smaller and color-coded (Cancel=red, Save=green) while matching the app’s overall styling.",
    "Planned-moment creation bottom sheet should use a clean eased translate (no bounce) and open to ~50% viewport height; inputs (time/title/etc.) should use pill-style containers like the search bar theme; action buttons should be narrower/smaller in the Get Started button style and color-coded (Cancel=red, Save=green); relationship selection cards should match the reference card style (e.g., vacuum cleaner/wifi styling).",
    "Backend Moments photo APIs now integrate with blob storage: `storePhoto` persists the provided blob and records a real timestamp, and `getBlob` is implemented to retrieve stored blobs via the storage module/mixin (no longer a placeholder).",
    "Calendar planned-moment creation bottom sheet should be ~75% viewport height (not 50%).",
    "Planned-moment Time input UI should be custom: separate hour/minute boxes with +/- steppers and optional direct typing, styled to match reference.",
    "Added shared UI overlay components (e.g., HamburgerMenu, SignInOverlay) to centralize menu/auth prompt presentation across pages rather than duplicating page-level UI patterns.",
    "Decision: do not remove the Moments tab yet; proceed by building the new Home (post-capture verification) screen and Profile logic/storage alongside the existing app flow.",
    "Scope clarification: Keep the Moments tab/section for now (do not remove yet); build the new Home screen additions and Profile logic/storage alongside existing navigation.",
    "Added local-first profile persistence utilities (`profileStorage`) and a `useProfile` hook to load/save profile name + image without requiring backend connectivity.",
    "Introduced a reusable `MomentsImageCard` component and integrated it into the Home screen to render the new 'Moments image' section while preserving the existing Home layout.",
    "UI direction: adopt glassmorphic styling as the new default for card components app-wide (excluding buttons).",
    "Location behavior: use automatic browser geolocation (permission-based) to fetch user location by default; must handle denial/unavailable states gracefully."

  "knownIssues": [
    "Environment variable names appear inconsistent/typo-prone in blob storage: `CAFFFEINE_STORAGE_CASHIER_PRINCIPAL` (extra 'F') may not match intended deployment configuration.",
    "Duplicate/competing global CSS files exist (`frontend/src/index.css` and `frontend/index.css`), which can cause confusion or styling inconsistencies depending on build configuration; the app imports `./index.css` from `src/main.tsx` (i.e., `frontend/src/index.css`).",
    "Home screen 'Add Your Moment' promotional button has no click handler (non-functional call-to-action).",
    "Splash screen comments mention GSAP, but the shown implementation uses CSS classes; dependency/intent may be mismatched.",
    "UI regression: button styling changed globally after latest changes; user requests reverting all buttons to prior styling without altering overall design.",
    "UI regression: splash slide card animations/motion no longer behave as previously implemented; needs restoration to prior motion behavior.",
    "Calendar UI currently not matching desired design: needs single-row week view, smaller/cleaner styling (no emojis/blue), and smoother plan-creation sheet motion",
    "Camera capture/upload does not reliably persist photos to the Moments feed; users report Moments not updating after snapping a photo.",
    "Calendar behavior/functionality has been reported as 'dummy'/non-functional by the user; needs to be backed by real 2026 dates and user data rather than placeholder UI.",
    "Deployments are failing intermittently; user requests redeploy but build/deploy pipeline returns 'Deployment failed'.",
    "Deployment failures persist intermittently (redeploy attempts continue to fail), blocking rapid iteration/testing.",
    "Internet Identity sign-in reliability issue: sign-in/redirect does not work consistently across all browsers and may not handle already-signed-in users (reauth/continue) correctly."
