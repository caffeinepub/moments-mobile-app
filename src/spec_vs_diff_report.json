  "summary": "VaultPage was updated to a larger, 2-column tile grid with month header hierarchy and per-tile staggered animation delays; VaultMomentPage gained an exit-state to animate back navigation; global CSS adds Vault design tokens and sets Bricolage Grotesque as the app font. One functional change (limiting moments to 6 per month) appears unrequested, and explicit evidence of an “enter” transition into the viewer is not shown in the provided diffs.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Entering the moment viewer and returning to the Vault feels intentionally animated (e.g., backdrop/image/overlay animations) and does not introduce navigation glitches.",
      "reason": "The diff shows an exit animation path when leaving the viewer (isExiting + timeout) but does not show any corresponding enter/initial-mount animation state or logic for the viewer transition into VaultMomentPage. CSS may exist but is not evidenced in the provided snippet for VaultMomentPage.",

    {
      "description": "Limit Vault month groups to a maximum of 6 photos per month.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on layout/styling/motion only and explicitly keeps Vault behavior intact aside from presentation; truncating each month’s moments changes what is displayed and is not requested.",
