  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented (promo card removed from Home per repo summary). REQ-2 implemented via a new auto-geolocation hook wired into the existing local-first profile storage. REQ-3 implemented via a reusable `.glass-card` CSS utility and adoption in `MomentsImageCard`; Home empty-state glass styling is claimed in a modified summary file but the HomeScreen code snippet is truncated so it can’t be directly verified from the shown code.",

      "description": "Documentation claims multiple unrelated UI/feature changes (e.g., GSAP dependency, TikTok-style vertical scrolling with background music, splash/welcome/calendar animation enhancements, preloading media, hamburger menu morph animation, sign-in overlay behavior, etc.) that were not requested in the BuildRequest.",
      "reason": "These items appear in the modified `frontend-file-summaries.txt` descriptions but are outside the requested scope (promo card removal, auto geolocation persisted to profile.location, and glassmorphic card styling). The diff summary does not provide corresponding code changes for these items, so at minimum they are unrequested additions to documentation.",
