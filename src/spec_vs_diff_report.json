  "summary": "The diff primarily adds/updates global CSS splash animation keyframes and updates the Internet Identity hook; it does not show concrete, app-wide button-style reversion across all pages nor the full restoration of the Splash/Onboarding card transition motion/layering behavior to a pre-Calendar baseline.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Revert ALL app buttons to the styling and interaction behavior that existed before the Calendar feature was implemented (sizes, borders, shadows, hover/active/disabled states, typography) across Splash/Onboarding, Welcome, Home, Camera, Moments, Calendar, and Settings; ensure Calendar-specific button styles do not leak globally.",
      "reason": "Only a portion of global CSS is shown, and the diff does not provide evidence of specific button style/interaction changes across the listed pages/components or scoping fixes to prevent Calendar styles from impacting other buttons.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Restore Splash/Onboarding slide card motion/animations to the exact pre-Calendar behavior (transition timing/easing/direction, layering/z-index, pointer-events correctness, and per-card content entrance animations).",
      "reason": "The diff shows added/updated CSS keyframes/classes for some entrance/transition animations, but it does not show changes to the slideshow/card transition implementation (likely in the Splash/Onboarding component) needed to ensure timing/easing/direction, layering, and pointer-events behavior match the pre-Calendar state.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Internet Identity hook behavior changes (e.g., delegation validity handling / cross-browser compatibility adjustments).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is strictly about reverting global button styling regressions and restoring splash slide card motion; it explicitly states no backend work and does not request auth-flow modifications.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/hooks/useInternetIdentity.ts"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Addition of project state metadata file.",
      "reason": "No requirement asks for adding project documentation/state files; request is limited to UI regression reverts.",
