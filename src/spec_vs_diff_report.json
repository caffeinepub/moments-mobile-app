  "summary": "REQ-1 appears to be implemented via CSS updates in `frontend/src/index.css` to make planned-moment pill cards slimmer/more elongated while keeping the border-only moment.color-based styling. However, the actual planned-moment CSS section is not visible in the truncated `index.css` excerpt, so verification relies on the diff summary text. Two additional non-requested metadata/documentation files were also modified.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest requirements and constraints focus on styling changes in `frontend/src/index.css` for planned-moment card classes; it does not request updates to repository summary/state files.",
