# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Revamp the Vault overview gallery to feel less cramped on mobile with larger thumbnails, more premium styling, and richer motion throughout the Vault browsing and moment viewing experience.

**Planned changes:**
- Redesign VaultPage gallery layout for mobile: reduce columns and increase tile sizes/spacing while preserving month grouping and tap-to-open behavior.
- Update Vault thumbnail tile visuals to a cohesive, premium card system (surface treatment, borders/shadows, corner radius) and align Vault typography with the existing Bricolage Grotesque usage on the warm/beige baseline background.
- Enhance motion and interaction: smoother entrance animations for month sections/tiles (using existing in-view patterns), clear press/tap feedback on tiles, and more polished animated transitions when entering/exiting VaultMomentPage.

**User-visible outcome:** Vault photos appear as larger, easier-to-tap tiles with improved visual hierarchy and a more polished, animated feel when browsing months and opening/closing individual moments.
