        "Planned-moment cards render with noticeably less vertical thickness than before (reduced overall height).",
        "Cards read as more elongated capsules (higher width-to-height ratio) without changing the overall layout structure (left dot, center text stack, right stacked icons).",
        "No regressions to functionality: share and delete actions still work, and text remains readable/truncated appropriately (no overflow outside the pill).",
        "The pill remains border-only with transparent interior and border color still matches `moment.color`."

          "description": "Adjust `.planned-moment-card-clear` to be slimmer by reducing vertical padding and tightening internal gap while keeping width: 100%, transparent background, and the border using `--card-border-color`. Update `.planned-moment-card-color-dot` size/position to stay vertically centered within the slimmer pill. Reduce typography size/line-height for `.planned-moment-card-date` and `.planned-moment-card-secondary-line` as needed to fit without overflow. Tighten `.planned-moment-card-actions-column` gap and reduce `.planned-moment-card-action-icon` dimensions/font-size so the right-side stacked icons remain aligned and fully clickable within the reduced height."
